A disk image is a image file that contains a image that has files and even operating systems these can be restored and you will have basicly the same computer as the one where the image file was created

dd if=/dev/zero of=file.img bs=1M count=50

A partition is part of one disk like a hard drive but runs multiple things like a mac running mac and windows those are 2 partitions.

By default one but you can create as many as space allows

If you mount an image it may not mount all the partitions

You must learn what partions are on the disk to make sure they are all mounted.
