There are 9 directories they consist of 2 IPM folders 1 Reminders folder a Search Root folder and a folder called Top of Personal Folders.

They are kept in the Top of Personal Folders/Inbox folder once there you can open teh directory that has all the information for each seperate message.

In the OutlookHeaders.txt file for Message00214 we see that the email was sent from tuckgorge@gmail.com and hidden to look like alison sent it.

From this information we are able to determine that what most likely happend a person with the tuckgorge email disquised his information and requested this email. Jean thought it was alison and send him an excel document with this information. A virus was also placed on the computer by a user named devon. This is probably a screen grab virus that was used to obtain infromation to allow the emails from alison to look more authentic.
