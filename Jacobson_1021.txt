File carving is taking several smaller files and putting them back together 
to allow the disk to be searchable and to allow for investigation of the disk.

It is done by finding file that look to have a sequence that fits together 
like a patern thus meaning that those 2 files go together.

I was not present yesterday but from what I understand twe covered partions.
This relates because partions use file systems and if they become corrupt
then you would need file carving to recover the file from the partition.
