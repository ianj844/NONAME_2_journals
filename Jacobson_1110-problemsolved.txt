There are several diffrent applications that you can use to recover deleted images.
1. PhotoRec I dont know if we can use it but it looks like it is really only used for disks or sd cards not disk images.
2. Extundelete Yes we can because it supports the proper file extentions.
3. Testdisk This does not directly allow us te recover deleted pictures but it does help recover/ repair lost/ broken partitions to allow us to recover the pictures off of them.

Mainly all you need to know is the file type of the partition and maybe the na,e of the file or image type(.png, .jpg)
